# WOLFRACKET
### A Racket Mathematics and Graphing REST API

## driver.rkt
This file runs the application.

## server-handler.rkt
The server creates an instance with a couple pages.

| page name | purpose|
|-----------|----------|
| home | The application home page, this page will describe the project as well as have input fields to display it in action.|
| api | The API documentation page explaining the methods available how to call them and their expected responses.|

To use the server-handler

```
#lang racket

;   REQUIRES
(require racket/include)

;   Including the server class
(include "server-handler.rkt")

;   Starting the server
((server-handler) 'start)
```

## api.rkt
The api extends the server pages by adding methods to the api landing page.

| page name | purpose|
|-----------|----------|
|api/*| The api method landing point, * represents the available pages. these pages take a json sting input and return json strings. In case of error they return http response codes. |

Currently the api has the methods ...

| page name | purpose|
|-----------|----------|
| api/add | To support addition during the integration phase |

To use the api

```
((((api) m) req)
```

Where m is the api method to call such as add, and req is the web request
generated by the server-handler class.

## json.rkt
In progress.

### math.rkt

This is our custom math operations library, current operations allowed are...

| method | params | returns|
|--------|--------|--------|
|'subtract| a b | a - b| 
|'add | a b | a + b| 
|'exponent| a b | a ^ b| 
|'divide| a b | a / b| 
|'prime_check| a | #t or #f | 
|'nat-log| a b | a - b| 
|'factorials| a | a! | 
|'sinus| a | sin( a )| 
|'cosh| a | cos( a )|    
|'root| a | a ^ (1/2) | 

To use the class 

```
(((my_math)  method) params ...)
```

where method are the operations allowed by the class and params are the needed parameters for the operation.
