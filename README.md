# WOLFRACKET
### A Racket Mathematics and Graphing REST API

## Purpose
To set up a racket Webserver with API landing points that interpret JSON input, which would then be processed by Racket to evaluated solutions. These solutions would then be returned by the webserver and in JSON form, images would be returned as links.
